# ### 22. Basic “Plugin System”
# - Organize a `plugins/` folder with multiple sub-modules.
# - Each sub-module exposes a `register()` function or similar behavior.
# - Write a script that detects and imports all plugins in this folder, then calls their `register()` function.
#
# **Key Points:** Dynamic loading, plugin pattern, modular architecture.
